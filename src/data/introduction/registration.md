## What is n8n?

**n8n** is a powerful, open-source workflow automation platform that allows you to connect different apps and services without writing code. Think of it as a visual programming tool where you can create automated workflows by connecting various "nodes" - each representing a different service or action.

With n8n, you can automate repetitive tasks like:
- Processing emails and creating tasks
- Syncing data between different platforms
- Responding to webhooks and API calls
- Automating social media posts and much more

The beauty of n8n lies in its visual, drag-and-drop interface that makes automation accessible to everyone, regardless of technical background.
