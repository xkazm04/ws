Let’s talk about [The Idea](https://coda.io/d/_d3PFXo2bENf/_suMN_) next.

# The Idea

# What will we solve?🌱

**Goal:** Automatically triage and process e-mails from **Jan Moravec** that arrive to your **Google Mail** (gmail) inbox. Process them by **AI** (Gemini) and create **Asana** tasks for emails that require your action.

**Flow:**
    1. Fetch unread Gmail messages.
    2. Analyze emails with AI & decide if an action is needed from you.
    3. **If action required** → create an Asana task.
    4. **Else** → mark the email as read and delete it 🗄️

> *Outcome:* Important e-mails from [Jan Moravec](mailto:c_jmoravec@groupon.com) don’t get missed 💌 & your work is tracked in Asana ✅

Now that you know what we'll be doing, let's get set up. [**Setting up tools for today's workshop?**](https://coda.io/d/_d3PFXo2bENf/_suUr3)
